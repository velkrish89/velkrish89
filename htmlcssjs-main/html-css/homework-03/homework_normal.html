            <h3>This is entire section is a normal layout</h3>
            <p>
                Here the elements are laid out one after the other. Just as they are placed in the HTML code.
                Elements that appear one after the other are <i>block</i> elements. Like the header tag and the paragraph tags.
                Elements that appear next to each other, like the text in a paragraph are all <i>inline</i> elements.
                <br>
                We have already seen about block & inline elements before. The point being these elements automatically enforce
                and provide this layout just like that. You dont have to do anything about it.
                <br>
                In most cases, like text displays or forms, this normal layout is the basic layout that you'd want (perhaps some
                styling tweaks at best). For more complex layout, you'll have to modify and adjust this normal layout with other
                options we will see below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, the header tag is laid out</li>
                <li>Then the paragraph tag</li>
                <li>Finally its the unordered list</li>
                <li>Finished with another paragraph tag next</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>The end!</p>  
        </div>
        
        <div class="normal-layout-mods">
            <p>here the list below should have been ordered one after the other in new lines but they are not because we changed the display property</p>
        <ul>
            <li>first element</li>
            <li>second element</li>
            <li>third element</li>
